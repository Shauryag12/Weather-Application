# Weather-app

This weather app is designed using HTML, JS, and CSS, and is powered by OpenWeatherMap. The app displays real-time weather information for the user's current location or any other location they search for.

The main page of the app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather. The user can also view additional details such as the wind speed and humidity.

The app includes a search bar where users can input any location they want to know the weather for, and the app will display the weather information for that location. The search function uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather information for the specified location.
